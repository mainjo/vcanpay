<h4>I. The Legal Relationship between You and vcanpay</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
    By registering for the Service, you appoint vcanpay as your agent to process payments on your behalf in accordance
    with your instructions, subject to the terms and restrictions of this Agreement. vcanpay shall not be liable to you
    unless a damage or loss is caused by vcanpay's willful misconduct or gross negligence.
    You shall consider carefully and accept any risks of using the vcanpay payment service.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vcanpay will at all times hold your funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use
    your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes, and will not voluntarily make funds available
    to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose. You acknowledge that
    (i) vcanpay is not a bank and the Service is a payment processing service rather than a banking service, and
    (ii) vcanpay is not acting as a trustee, fiduciary or escrow with respect to your funds, but is acting only as an
    agent or custodian.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You are not required to keep funds in the vcanpay system (i.e., carry a balance in your vcanpay account) in order to
    use the Service. If you do carry a Baht balance in your vcanpay account, vcanpay will pool your funds together with
    funds from other Users, and will place those funds in accounts at one or more banks ("Pooled Accounts"). You agree
    that any earnings on the Pooled Accounts will be the property of vcanpay, and you will not receive interest or other
    earnings on the funds that vcanpay handles as your agent. Balances held in currencies other than Baht will not be
    placed with the banks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    By initiating and sending payments through the Service or adding funds to your balance, you appoint vcanpay as your
    agent to obtain the funds on your behalf and to transfer the funds to the recipient that you designate or to a
    ‘Pooled Account’, subject to the terms and restrictions of this Agreement. vcanpay will obtain the funds first by
    debiting your funds in the Pooled Accounts, if any. If this is not sufficient to fund your payment fully, vcanpay
    will obtain the remaining funds per your instructions by debiting a bank account that you designate or charging your
    credit card. When you send a payment, until that payment is accepted by the recipient (which may occur instantly),
    you remain the owner of those funds and vcanpay holds those funds as your agent, but you agree not to withdraw those
    funds or send the funds to any other recipient unless
    the initial transaction is cancelled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    By receiving payments through the Service, you appoint vcanpay as your agent to cause the funds to be deposited on
    your behalf in the Pooled Accounts until you further instruct vcanpay with respect to the transmission of your
    funds. Through the vcanpay website, you may provide instructions to withdraw the funds, or transfer the funds to a
    third party, in each case subject to the terms and restrictions of this Agreement. If you receive a notice that a
    payment has been sent to you through vcanpay but you have not registered for the Service, vcanpay will not become
    your agent and you will have no claim to those funds unless and until you register for the Service and indicate your
    acceptance of the payment.</p>

    Agreement, your access to the Service may be suspended or terminated. You shall not withdraw or claim any or all of
    the remaining funds from your account. You will cooperate fully with vcanpay to investigate any suspected unlawful,

    consent to receive Communications electronically, vcanpay will terminate your right to use the Service.<br>

    e-mail address. Although we will take reasonable steps to contact you based on information that you have provided
    us, vcanpay will not be liable for any undelivered e-mail communications or any costs you incur for maintaining
    Internet access and an e-mail account. You have an AFFIRMATIVE OBLIGATION to provide vcanpay with a correct and
    operational e-mail address, and to notify vcanpay promptly as to any changes or cancellations of any and all e-mail
    addresses you provide vcanpay. Failure to provide vcanpay with a current, working, functional, personal e-mail
    address, and/or failure to update vcanpay in a change or cancellation of your e-mail address, or if vcanpay has

    secondary e-mail address as a new permanent e-mail address associated with your account; (3) an alteration to your
    user preferences regarding vcanpay e-mail notifications; and/or (4) attempts by vcanpay to reach you personally by
    phone, fax or postal mail. vcanpay reserves the right to take measures to ensure the integrity of its contact
    directory, and expects that you, as a user, will cooperate and keep your contact information current.<br>
    <B>No Framing</B> - Because vcanpay members are warned never to enter their vcanpay account password into any page whose
    URL does not begin with /v20150728/, the use of "framing," where a third party site displays a portion of the
    vcanpay website inside a webpage whose URL is not /v20150728/, is prohibited.<br>
    <B>No Spam</B> - You agree not to use email addresses of vcanpay customers to send unsolicited email. You agree not to use
    unsolicited email, usenet, message board postings, or similar methods of mass messaging (spam) to gather referral
    bonuses. The use of spam to promote the Service has strict negative consequences. We will immediately and

    someone has transferred or may transfer money from your account without your permission. Under applicable banking
    regulations, the extent of your liability for an unauthorized transaction is largely determined by your promptness
    in notifying us or your bank if someone has gained access to your Password, or if a transfer or withdrawal in your

    You can inspect your transaction history at any time by logging in to your account on the vcanpay website. If your
    transaction history shows electronic funds transfers that you did not make or authorize, notify us at once.<br>
    In case of unauthorized transactions, payment problems, errors or questions about your account, you should notify

    If we determine there was no error, we will mail you a written explanation within three (3) business days after we
    finish the investigation.<br>

    to you if we find that an error did not occur. While the vcanpay service is available 7 days a week, for purposes of
    this disclosure, our business days are Monday through Friday except bank holidays.<br>

    You may close vcanpay Account by filling in the application with all required information, i.e., your listed email
    address, PSBID code, account bank number, etc. Upon Account closure, we will cancel any pending transactions and
    transfer to your bank account any balances less the bank charge.<br>
    Our failure to act with respect to any breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to
    subsequent or similar breaches.<br>
    If any paragraph of this Agreement or any portion thereof is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, such
    unenforceability or invalidity shall not invalidate the whole Agreement, but the Agreement shall be construed as if
    it did not contain the particular provision held to be invalid and the rights and obligations of the parties shall
    be construed and enforced accordingly.<br>
    Both parties consider Thai version of this Agreement as the legal binding document.</p>
